Treat every change as if it will be used by real users at scale.
Do not introduce temporary logic, free-text canonical data, silent fallbacks, or UI-only validation.
If something cannot be implemented with strict data integrity, clear ownership, and forward scalability, stop and propose a correct production-safe alternative instead of shipping a shortcut.
