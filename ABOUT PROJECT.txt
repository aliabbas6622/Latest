This website is an aptitude preparation platform designed around a strict separation of learning intent. The core idea is that learning aptitude requires two fundamentally different mental states: understanding concepts calmly, and practicing under pressure. Mixing these two creates confusion, cognitive overload, and ineffective learning. Most aptitude websites fail because they blend explanations and practice on the same page. This platform explicitly avoids that.

The entire website is divided into two core modes that the user intentionally enters: Understand mode and Apply mode. These are not just UI themes; they are functional and conceptual separations that affect content, navigation, and behavior.

Understand mode is for passive learning and conceptual clarity. It exists to explain how things work, not to test the user. In this mode, users read concept explanations for aptitude topics such as Percentages, Ratio & Proportion, Time & Work, Speed & Distance, Probability, etc. Content includes definitions, formulas, method breakdowns, logical patterns, heuristics, visual explanations (tables, number lines, flow diagrams), and fully solved examples that are meant to be read, not attempted. This mode also includes reference material like formula lists, shortcut summaries, and common traps. There are no quizzes, no MCQs, no timers, no scoring, no progress tracking, and no “check your answer” interactions. The UI is calm, reading-focused, and distraction-free. The only action allowed is an explicit link that sends the user to Apply mode if they want to practice the concept.

Apply mode is for active practice and skill-building. It exists to train execution, speed, and accuracy. In this mode, users solve questions: MCQs, short-answer problems, mixed practice sets, section-wise tests, and full mock exams. Practice can be untimed (for learning) or timed (for exam simulation). Users must attempt a question before seeing the solution. After submission, the system provides immediate feedback (correct/incorrect) with a very short explanation, followed by a full step-by-step solution if needed. Apply mode can include hints, but they are strictly limited and only help unblock the next step, not teach full theory. This mode includes progress tracking, performance summaries, and an error or mistake log that shows questions the user got wrong, why they failed, and what type of mistake it was (conceptual, calculation, or speed). Apply mode must not contain long theory explanations, formula derivations, or reference-style content. If something explains deeply, it belongs in Understand mode.

Some pages are neutral/meta pages and do not belong to either mode. These include the home page, onboarding flow, mode selection screen, profile, settings, and admin panels. These pages do not teach or test; they only route the user, manage preferences, or display account information.

The system enforces a no-mixing rule: no learning page should combine Understand and Apply content. If a page currently mixes both, it must be split into two separate pages, or explicitly documented as a rare hybrid exception. Hybrid exceptions are allowed only when strict separation would objectively harm learning (for example, guided walkthroughs that show a solved problem step-by-step with optional pauses). Hybrid pages must be rare, clearly labeled, and justified.

Navigation is intentionally minimal. The user must always know which mode they are in via a persistent indicator. Switching between modes must be explicit, never automatic. Search results may span both modes, but each result must be clearly labeled so users know whether they are opening an explanation or a practice item.

From a backend perspective, content is tagged by mode. Understand content stores explanations, concepts, references, and media. Apply content stores questions, attempts, results, feedback, and performance data. Infrastructure such as authentication and routing is shared to avoid unnecessary complexity.

The design philosophy is ruthless simplicity. Features are added only if removing them would clearly make learning worse. Gamification, leaderboards, streaks, social feeds, and decorative animations are intentionally avoided because they add noise without improving learning outcomes.

The success criteria for the website are simple: all functionality works with zero broken links or flows; every content page is clearly classified as Understand, Apply, Neutral, or a documented hybrid; users can explain the two-mode system without being told; and the site feels organized, intentional, and uncluttered.
