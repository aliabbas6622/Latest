# Project Overview: Aptitude Preparation Platform

This platform is built on a strict **mental state separation** philosophy, ensuring users are never overwhelmed by mixing theoretical learning with high-pressure practice.

## 🌗 Core Philosophy: The Dual-Mode System
To prevent cognitive overload, the platform is divided into two distinct, intentional modes:

### 📖 Understand Mode (Passive Learning)
**Goal:** Conceptual clarity and calm reading.
- **Content:** Definitions, formulas, method breakdowns, logical patterns, and fully solved examples.
- **Visuals:** Tables, number lines, flow diagrams, and heuristics.
- **Restrictions:** No timers, no MCQs, no progress tracking, and no pressure. The UI is distraction-free.
- **Navigation:** Only allows reading and an explicit link to "Apply" the concept.

### ⚡ Apply Mode (Active Practice)
**Goal:** Execution, speed, and accuracy training.
- **Content:** MCQs, short-answer problems, timed mock exams, and mixed practice sets.
- **Feedback:** Immediate "Correct/Incorrect" followed by step-by-step solutions.
- **Tools:** Limited hints (unblocking only), error logs, and performance tracking.
- **Restrictions:** No long theory or derivations. If it requires deep reading, it belongs in Understand mode.

## 🛠️ Guiding Principles
- **No-Mixing Rule:** Pages are strictly either *Understand* or *Apply*. Hybrid pages are rare, clearly labeled, and strictly justified exceptions.
- **Explicit Navigation:** Mode switching must be intentional, never automatic. Persistent indicators show the current mode.
- **Ruthless Simplicity:** No "noise" like gamification, leaderboards, or excessive animations. Features are only added if they directly improve learning.
- **Backend structure:** Content is tagged by mode (Theory vs. Practice data), sharing only essential infrastructure (Auth/Routing).

## ✅ Success Criteria
1. **Zero friction:** All links and flows work perfectly.
2. **Clear classification:** Every page adheres to its designated mode.
3. **Intuitive:** Users understand the system without a manual.
4. **Organized:** The interface feels intentional and uncluttered.
